# dubizzle-chatbot
I was really interested in cars since a young age, and dubizzle was my go to website to search for the prices of the latest cars.  
It was when I was recently using dubizzle that it struck me that unlike other websites, Dubizzle does not have a chatbot.  
So I thought that I could try to implement it as a project.  
One of my favourite cars is the Toyota 86. I created a dataset of the cars available on the Dubizzle website along with relevant information.  
I used the OpenAI API for answering queries.  
I used HTML, CSS and JS for the Frontend and Python as Backend.

A further improvement would be to fine tune the model in order to improve the accuracy. I will be working on it eventually.
